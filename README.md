## Build and run

The Android project is the `KMD` folder, not the repository root.

1. Install Android Studio and an Android SDK with compile SDK 35. The app module uses minSdk 26 and targetSdk 34 (Android 8.0 and above).
2. Clone this repository and open the `KMD` folder as the Gradle project.
3. Use the Gradle wrapper in that folder (`Gradle 9.4.1`). Use it if the machine JDK is newer than the JDK bundled with Android Studio.
4. Select the `app` run configuration and deploy the debug build to a Honeywell or Panasonic PDA, or to any Android 8+ phone. On Honeywell and Panasonic hardware the app binds to the in-built scanner. On other devices it asks for the camera and scans with ML Kit.
5. The first time the local database is created, the app loads a bundled demonstration product file and creates a sample location tree and sample boxes. Clearing the app’s data creates that database again. An install that already has a database is not reseeded.
